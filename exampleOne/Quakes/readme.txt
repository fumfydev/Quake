Quakes

This is a very simple implementation of an Android app to view Earthquakes downloaded from the
US Geological Survey sites Programmatic Access GeoJSON Summary Format.

The Android app is written using Retrofit2, Okhttp3, RxJava2, Greenrobot EventBus
and the Sugar ORM.

To build and fully use this app you will need a Google Maps API key to add to the
mobile/src/main/res/values/google_maps_api.xml file. This will enable the
Google maps to load.
